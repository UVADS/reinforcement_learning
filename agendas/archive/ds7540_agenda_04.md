### Content

- Review notebook k-armed bandit
  - Concepts:
    - single state
    - epsilon-greedy action selection
    - expected discounted total reward
    - action-value function, Q(a) vs q(a)
    - improving the policy by learning updated value estimates
    - Upper-Confidence-Bound Action Selection

- (time permitting) Review notebook: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Concepts:
    - Markov property
    - dynamics function p
    - state transition probability
    - expected rewards
    - signals in RL: states, actions, rewards
    - return (gains process) is sum of rewards
    - discounting
