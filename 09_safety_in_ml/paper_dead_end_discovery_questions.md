Authors: Mehdi Fatemi, Taylor Killian, Marzyeh Ghassemi

Carefully read the blog [post](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/using-reinforcement-learning-to-identify-high-risk-states-and-treatments-in-healthcare/) and watch the video near the bottom. We will discuss the questions below. 

As follow-up if you have an interest, you might explore the [paper](https://papers.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2021/file/26405399c51ad7b13b504e74eb7c696c-Paper.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/microsoft/med-deadend)  

If there is high demand in the course, we might explore some of this together.
