Wang, Schaul, Hessel, van Hasselt, Lanctot, de Freitas

Carefully read the paper. We will discuss the questions below. 

---

Questions for Discussion:

1) What is the main problem that this paper addresses?

2) How does the dueling Q-network work? In particular, explain the advantage function.

3) What is the benefit of replacing the max operator with an average in equation (9)?

4) How does the paper demonstrate the benefit of this approach?

5) Why does this approach confer an advantage over traditional Q-networks?
