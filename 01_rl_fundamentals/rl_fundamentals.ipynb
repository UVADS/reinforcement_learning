    "In this branch of machine learning, an *agent* learns by interacting with its *environment.*  \n",
    "An agent may be a human, robot, etc.  \n",
    "The agent has a goal: to maximize a quantitative measure of *reward*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many situations, the ground truth is not known:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a patient is treated for sepsis, a life-threatening emergency. what is the best treatment? \n",
    "- an investor must select from a universe of investments, managing portfolio risk and return over time. what is the best policy for dynamic allocation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In other situations, we may have access to stale ground truths. This is common in dynamic environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- trends and levels before versus during a pandemic\n",
    "- adversarial environments like finance and fraud where agents adapt their behavior\n",
    "- patient health following injury or illness\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrast with Supervised Learning (SL) where ground truth is provided up front.\n",

    "Contrast with Unsupervised Learning (UL) where structure is uncovered from unlabeled data.\n",
